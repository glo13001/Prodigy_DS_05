Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of traffic accident data from the United States. The analysis aims to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, and visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

About the Dataset

The traffic accident dataset used for this analysis provides detailed information about accidents, including attributes such as location, weather conditions, road type, time of day, and contributing factors.
